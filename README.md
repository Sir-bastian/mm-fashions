### MM Online Fashions

### Project Overview
This project is an e-commerce platform being built with Python and Django. The primary goal is to learn and solidify my skills in Django development by creating a functional online store. It's inspired by local businesses selling products like shoes on social media platforms.

While currently a learning project, the aim is to build a robust and scalable platform that could potentially support a small online fashion business in the future.

### Features (Currently Planned / In Progress)
--- Product Catalog: Displaying various fashion items (e.g., shoes) with details like name, description, price, and images.
--- User Authentication: Basic user registration and login.
---Sho pping Cart: Functionality to add, remove, and update items in a shopping cart.
--- Admin Panel: Django's built-in admin for managing products, users, and orders (future).

### Technologies Used
--- Backend: Python 3.x, Django 5.x (or your current Django version)
--- Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for future deployment consideration)
--- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic)
--- Version Control: Git
